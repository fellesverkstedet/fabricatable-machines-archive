* A gantry based CNC milling machine where a substantial amount of the parts can be fabricated on a CNC mill
* Linear rails, rack, pinion and glide blocks can all be fabricated on a conventional CNC milling machine
* Based on the chamfer rail system in this repo
* Work area is 600mm x 300mm x 50mm
* The rack and pinion has 4.444444 steps per mm with a 200 step motor

**Design wins**
* It is possible to build a big machine with the chamfer rail system
* Making long rails with the chamfer rail system is easy and fast
* Combining standard proportion chamfer rails with custom machine parts *(axis plate, bed and gantry)* works great.
* Pure POM/Delrin glide blocks on aluminum rail is ok, but not optimal. Next is testing PTFE infused POM. Worst case we will have to revert to brass for glide surfaces.
* Gluing up a stack of HDF plates for the bed and gantry works great
* Finish milling the HDF stack on the bed of a larger CNC mill works great, but requires high level CNC milling skills
* Pockets for self threading wood screws in the POM glide block and machinebed sandwich works great
* The machine is able to mill 5mm thick steel

**Design fails**
* The contact sufrace of the glide blocks is too small for heavy loads. The combination of a slightly skew glide block with small contact surface are makes the POM blocks scratch the alu rails. This quickly became a problem on the X axis because the two glide blaocks carried the entire load of the gantry. *(big single block instead of two small have been successfully tested)*
* It is difficult to make very long and precise rails with the chamfer rail system. *(our 900mm long X axes were a bit higher in the middle during chamfer millng)*
* The two motors on the X axis should be more towards the front to counter balance the weight of the gantry, z axis, spindle and motors
* Dust control on the rails and rack still need to be developed. *(early tests with felt pads seem promising)*
* The glide blocks requires very carefull calibration
* The pinion set screws are critical, there should be two set scrwes at 90degress on the pinions

### To do

* Make X rail be able to move smooth with the heavy weight of the gantry *(larger glide block has improved the situation significantly)*
* Find a way to stop the X rails to scratch/wear from the pressure of the glide blocks *(lining block with PTFE could be great)*
* Make dust shoe for extraction
* Make sound and dust insulating box
* Make safety power switch on box
* Fix end stops on all axes
* Make Z plate for auto homing
* Mod various post processors for starting with autohoming
* Do extensive testing
* Improve documentation
* Make BOM (bill of materials)
* Test self-replication *(first set of chamfer rail axes have already been made for Fellesverkstedets Fab Academy students)*


### Handy replicape commands

* M119 for get endstop states
* G92 for custom home example: G92 X0 Y0 Z0

### Testing performance

![5mm steel](./img/dry-machining-5mm-steel.jpg)
*Dry machining 5mm low carbon steel in one pass. Trochoidal milling at 50mm/s, 10% stepover. Using a 3 flute 6mm bit at 30.000RPM. Router is a lowcost Makita RT0700C*

![ISP PCB](./img/hank-test-pcb-mill1.jpg)
*Testing precision by milling circuit for ISP programmer. No-tune up between steel milling and this test. Circuit milled with a wood v-bit, not proper pcb bit*

![ISP PCB2](./img/hank-test-pcb-mill2.jpg)
*First test on the right was milled at too high speed (15mm/s with single flute V-Bit bit). The more succesfull test on the right was milled at 6mm/s.*
